# Spell Checker with Dynamic Programming
The system checks whether a given word is in the dictionary. If it cannot find the word in the dictionary, it will give correct word suggestions from the words in the dictionary.

If the word is misspelled or is not likely to be found, the necessary information will be provided. The Hashing Algorithm will be used to quickly access the dictionary where words are stored, and the Levenshtein Edit Distance Algorithm will be used to suggest a new word instead of a word that is not found in the dictionary or is misspelled.
